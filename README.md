Welcome to the Freedoc application

After entering into the folder, please type in your terminal :

$ bundle install


This app is  similar to Doctolib : you can take an appointment as a patient, with a doctor that has several specialties. You can take as many appointments as you like, according to the city or the specialty of the doctor. 

The app contains fake data, to test its functionnality. To play with it, you can type in your terminal :

$ rails console

And then feel free to check all the data in there. A gem called tape_print has been added into the app, so if you type in the rails console "tp" before the data you want to show, it will be nicely organized. For example "tp Docor.all"

Enjoy !
